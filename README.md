## Quick Start
Currently, this app only supports for Android. I am unable to test the app for IOS platform, since I don't have any apple device. Contact me if you want to help me testing for IOS platform! :D

## History
Migrated to an upcoming blog site üöõ...


## About VNDB
It is a website that houses a large public database of Visual Novels, hence the name stands for Visual Novel DataBase (VNDB). You can learn more about the website itself [here](https://vndb.org/).


## About VNDB Lite

> Do read the disclaimer above first please.

Built with <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Flutter-02569B?style=for-the-badge&logo=flutter&logoColor=white)"></img>

This app is still in development, and is heavily inspired by Tachiyomi (A digital comic reading app), someone from reddit which I forgot, and a picture I found from the internet which looks really cool! That picture gave me a lot of inspiration. I tried to make one like that, but I ended up having a lite version and a sleep apnea instead.

<img src="./media/inspiration.png" width="350px" height = "250px"></img>

If you ever use Tachiyomi or similar app, then I assure you can adapt fast with this app's UI.

VNDB Lite is currently released for **Android only**, and it only supports **Android 5.0+**. 

Unfortunately and currently, I don't have any IOS device to neither build nor even test the app. But as the framework (Flutter) itself supports cross-platform, you can build yourself the app from the source code for your own specific platform, and then test it.


## Main Features
As the name stated: **Lite**, this app does not cover the entire feature you might found in the original website itself, though, some of the fundamentals are covered in this app.

Here are the features:
1. Up to 11 VNDB official themes (though some of them sucks, I really am following the official theme, so don't blame me lol)

2. Previews of VNs (Based on latest user collection, and Top-bys)
<br>[![Previews](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/50/000000/video.png)](https://github.com/Daniel-C-J/vndb-lite/raw/refs/heads/master/media/feature/preview.mkv)

3. Advanced search

4.   Easy to save vn selection and multiselection

5. VNDB latest statistics chart (I know it's ugly, but at least it can **spin**)
<br><img src ="./media/feature/chart.png" width=150></img>

6. Local collection
   
7. VNDB account synchronization

8. Offline mode (Once entering vn detail screen)

9. Double-click to censor/uncensor cover üëÄ
10. (‡∏á„ÉÑ)‡∏ß And many more...!

> [!WARNING]
> VNDB Lite Synchronization does not support the following:
> 1. Custom status other than the built-in ones, such as: `playing, finished, stalled, dropped, wishlist, and blacklist`. Other than that will be considered invalid and will not be synchronized.
> 2. A VN item which has multiple status on it, such as: `playing`, and `dropped` in a single item, that is not fully valid. Synchronization with VNDB Lite will only take **one** from the two. But any of the built-in status with `voted` is valid.
> 3. Saving the changes made from the cloud to the local once successfully synchronized. VNDB Lite's synchronization is local-oriented, so once user synchronized, any change from the cloud, such as **editing** an already existing item, will not be tolerated, and will be overrided instead by the local existing ones instead the moment user synchronizing again. 
> The same thing happens when **deleting** an item from the cloud, once synchronizing again, if the item still exists in local, then it will go back to the cloud (in a form of a backup). The only thing that local tolerated with cloud changes, is that **adding** a new item from the cloud, and that will be saved in the local.
> 4. The ability to immediately synchronize lot of vns (probably 60+) at once in a single synchronization. There are times when your cloud vns are not fully synchronized in the local collection after the first time synchronization, especially if you've lots of vns in your vndb collection. Make sure that after a short delay, try to synchronize again until it fully indexing all of your cloud vns in the local collection.
>
> **Consider changing your collection via vndb.org first to make sure that all of your VNs are valid when synchronizing using this app.**
